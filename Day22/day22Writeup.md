# Day 22 Writeup:
## Languages Used: `Go`
## Part 1:
Looking at the first part of this problem, it was clearly evident that they made it much easier than the previous problems they have posted. They seemed to have a lot of graph problems this time, so I am  relieved for not doing another graph problem.

This one required simple calculation and the manipulation of bits, all of the information which was already provided to us.

In fact for at least the first part, the main thing was to just get the input and add up after doing about 2000 manipulations for each number. 

Thus, within the main method, I could get my answer.

## Part 2:
This one was a little interesting. Initially I thought how bad could it be to try and brute force the answer. It worked, but it did end up taking a very long time for me to get the answer.<br>
I left it on for a while, and it spewed the answer to me in 10 minutes later, which is a very long time for a program to be running.

Nevertheless, I seem to have satisfied the monkeys with their bananas.

And with that , another two challenges that are done for the day!

Thus, I can conclude the `Day 22` of the `Advent of Code 2024`...<br>
Awaiting for the next day!
